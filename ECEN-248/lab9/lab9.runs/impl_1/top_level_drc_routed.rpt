2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clk_div0/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2/O, cell clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT clk_div0/Count[2]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    counter/Count_reg[0] {FDCE}
    counter/Count_reg[1] {FDCE}
    counter/Count_reg[2] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
