WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net U1/FSM_sequential_nextState_reg[2]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin U1/FSM_sequential_nextState_reg[2]_i_2/O, cell U1/FSM_sequential_nextState_reg[2]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
