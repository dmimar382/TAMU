No known problems with the code. 

Pseudocode: The written code represents a doubly linked list class for integers. I am able to create nodes that are connected in a list and preform insertion operations before the first node, after the last node,
as well as insertion anywhere in the middle of the list. I am also able to remove the first node, last node, or any node in the list. The copy constructor, move constructor, 
copy assignment operator and move assignment operator are fully operational. 
 


 
Program testing:
While writing the program, I tested every function to ensure its propper operation. For more details, please see DLList-main.cpp.
