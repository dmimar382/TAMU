/****************************************************************
The following program will ask for the user's first and last name,
birth year,and their height in feet and inches. The program will 
approximate the user's age and height in cm, as well as compute 
the user's average annual growth per year in centimeters, under 
the assumption that oneâ€™s height at birth is 51 cm.
